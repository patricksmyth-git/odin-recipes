        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Named after the Duke of Wellington, the Englishman who defeated Napolean, Beef Wellington is a famous English dish.</p>
        <p>Similar dishes most likely predate Beef Wellington by centuries.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound beef tenderloin filet</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons eltra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound mushrooms (cremini & shiitake mix)</li>
            <li>4 thin slices ham (Parma ham if you can get it) or prosciutto</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard (we used Coleman's Original English Mustard)</li>
            <li>1 (7 to 8 1/2-ounce sheet) puff pastry, thawed (see recipe note)</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F as you assemble the Wellington.</li>
            <li>Season the fillet generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a tablespoon or two of oil in a large pan on high heat.</li>
            <li>Sear the fillet in the pan on all sides until well browned. (Do not move the fillet until it is browned.)</li>
            <li>Remove the fillet from the pan & let it cool.</li>
            <li>Brush the fillet on all sides with mustard.</li>
            <li>Chop the mushrooms. Purée them in a food processor.</li>
            <li>Heat the saute pan on medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the mushroom purée to the pan and cook, allowing the mushrooms to release their moisture.</li>
            <li>Once the moisture has been boiled away, remove the mushrooms from the pan and set them aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Roll out a large piece of plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Lay out slices of ham on the plastic wrap so that they overlap.</li>
            <li>Spread the mushroom mixture over the ham.</li>
            <li>Place the beef fillet in the middle of the ham & mushroom base.</li>
            <li>Roll the mushroom and ham base over the fillet, using the plastic wrap to do this tightly.</li>
            <li>Wrap the beef fillet into a tight barrel shape, twisting the ends of the plastic wrap to secure. Refrigerate this for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>On a lightly-floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a size that will wrap around the beef fillet.</li>
            <li>Unwrap the fillet from the plastic wrap and place it in the middle of the pastry dough.</li>
            <li>Brush the edges of the pastry with the beaten egg yolks.</li>
            <li>Fold the pastry around the fillet. Cut off any excess pastry. Try not to overlap the pastry much.</li>
            <li>Place the fillet on a small plate, seam-side down, and brush with beaten egg yolks all over the top.</li>
            <li>Chill the fillet for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Put the fillet on a baking pan. Brush the exposed surface again with beaten eggs.</li>
            <li>Score the top of the pastry with a sharp knife (DO NOT GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PASTRY.)</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the top with coarse salt.</li>
            <li>Bake in the 400 degree oven for 25-35 minutes. The pastry will be golden when finished.</li>
            <li>Test the meat with an instant-read thermometer. Take the Wellington out of the oven at 125-130 degrees for medium-rare.</li>
            <li>Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Slice in 1-inch thick slices and serve.</li>
